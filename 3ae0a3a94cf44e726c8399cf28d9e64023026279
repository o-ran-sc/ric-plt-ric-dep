When more testing is done and issues are fixed, we can make this as \"1.0.0\" release for the charts.\n\nI have started numbering fresh for the charts (even though I am using as reference some original charts) so that it\u0027s easier to maintain this and when this is ready, the old charts can be deprecated.",
